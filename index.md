# diseasy

## Overview

Leveraging combinatorial building for ensemble forecasting in disease
modelling.

## The power of combinations

`diseasy` is framework for disease modelling that is built around the
philosophy of combinatorial building. Even from a small number of
modules, an ensemble consisting of a vast array of disease models can be
constructed by combining individual modules.

## The power of ensembles

Ensemble models of disease spread typically outperforms individual
models in terms of robust and accurate forecasts. With `diseasy`,
ensemble models are leveraged to support evidence-based decision-making
and pandemic preparedness.

## Installation

``` r
# Install diseasy from CRAN:
install.packages("diseasy")

# Alternatively, install the development version from github:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ssi-dk/diseasy")
```
