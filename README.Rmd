## Overview
Leveraging combinatorial building for ensemble forecasting in disease
modelling.

## The power of combinations
`diseasy` is framework for disease modelling that is built around the
philosophy of combinatorial building. Even from a small number of
modules, an ensemble consisting of a vast array of disease models can be
constructed by combining individual modules.

## The power of ensembles
Ensemble models of disease spread typically outperforms individual
models in terms of robust and accurate forecasts. With `diseasy`,
ensemble models are leveraged to support evidence-based decision-making
and pandemic preparedness.
